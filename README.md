## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my knowledge of HTML & CSS. I found it useful to practice implementing flexbox on a straightforward project. 

My biggest learning point from this project is to not use set heights and widths for ease of creating a responsive design. As I began the project, I was more focused on the content and styling before responsiveness. It would have been much easier if I'd considered responsiveness as I coded and used alternatives to px.

### Continued development

Continuing on I will be focusing on making responsive designs, in an efficient way. As I'm confident with Flexbox, I'm also going to create more projects using CSS Grid.
